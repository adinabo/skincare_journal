# Skincare Routine Tracker

A Skincare Routine Tracker is a straightforward app designed to help users manage their skincare routines. 

As a skincare enthusiast, I've observed that many people are unsure about which products to use, the optimal timing for their application, and which products should not be combined. By developing this simple tracker, users can log their skincare products into the app, which will help them keep track of their skincare routine.

## Rationale and Purpose

### Why a Skincare Routine Tracker?
Maintaining a consistent and effective skincare routine can be challenging, especially for those new to skincare or looking to optimize their regimen. Understanding which products to use, when to apply them, and which combinations to avoid is crucial for achieving the best results and avoiding adverse reactions. As a passionate skincare enthusiast, I recognized a gap in accessible tools that could guide users through this process.

### The Problem:
1. Product Confusion: With a plethora of skincare products available, it can be overwhelming to determine what each product does and when it should be used in a routine.

2. Timing and Order: The effectiveness of skincare products can depend significantly on the order of application and the time of day they are used.

3. Product Incompatibility: Certain skincare ingredients should not be mixed due to potential adverse reactions or reduced efficacy.
### The Solution:
The Skincare Routine Tracker is a simple yet powerful app designed to assist users in managing their evening skincare routines. By allowing users to log their skincare products, the app can generate a personalized routine that maximizes the benefits of each product while ensuring safe and effective use.

# Skincare Routine Tracker

A Skincare Routine Tracker is a straightforward app designed to help users manage their evening skincare routines. 

As a skincare enthusiast, I've observed that many people are unsure about which products to use, the optimal timing for their application, and which products should not be combined. By developing this simple tracker, users can log their skincare products into the app, which will then generate a personalized routine for them.
